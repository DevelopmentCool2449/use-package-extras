;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides the following extra keyword for
;; `use-package':
;;
;; * :setopt
;;   Similar to :custom, but can also bind plain variables.
;;   This uses the `setopt' function, for bind the variables.
;;
;;   (<variable> . <value>)
;;

;;; Code:

;;; Requires
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'use-package)

(require 'use-package-extras-core)



;;; Add keyword to `use-package-extras-keywords'
(use-package-extras--add-to-list :setopt)

;;; Functions
