;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides the following extra keyword for
;; `use-package':
;;
;; * :which-key-replacement
;;   A simple way to set your which-key replacement keybindings.
;;
;;   The form can be a any of these options:
;;
;;   A cons-cell which will be passed as arguments for
;;   which-key-add-key-based-replacements
;;
;;     :which-key-replacement
;;     ("C-c d" . "foo")
;;     ("C-x 8" . '("unicode" . "Unicode keys"))
;;     ...
;;
;;   A list which specifies a keymap, passed as arguments for
;;   which-key-add-keymap-based-replacements
;;
;;     :which-key-replacement
;;     (:keymap global-map
;;              ("C-x a" "pretty name" command-name)
;;              -- To add a prefix command, enclose it into a list--
;;              ("C-c a" "prefix" (prefix-map))
;;              ...)
;;
;;   Or a list which specifies a major mode, passed as arguments for
;;   which-key-add-major-mode-key-based-replacements
;;
;;     :which-key-replacement
;;     (:mode major-mode
;;            ("C-c f" . "foo")
;;            ("C-c e" . '("prefix" . "Pretty name"))
;;            ...)
;;
;; To use it load this library in your init file:
;;
;;   (require 'use-package-x-which-key)
